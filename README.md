# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version: ruby 3.0.1p64
- Contributers: Mabelys Arias (Owner)
- Name: Tidy Park
- Description: Tidy Park is an application with all the basic CRUD actions, RESTful routes, Ruby on Rails on the backend, Vue.js with Bootstrap on the frontend, a mapbox api and a JS library. Tidy Park helps to mobilize the community to clean up local parks in New York City. The user can create an account, sign into the account, select a park that needs some TLC (clean up), report their observations and post their findings. The app would then return the most requested park that needs the most attention on the landing page, and in turn the interested users will know which park to tackle next.
- Deployment: Used heroku and Netlify. You can view website here: https://tidypark.netlify.app
